Hi, my name is Kapil Gupta. I am a Machine Learning and Computer Vision Engineer. I have a wide range of interests from Biology to AI to Singing. I like to read
Fiction and eat ice-cream. I have created this blog as an information dump about everything I come across and find fascinating.

Peace Out.
