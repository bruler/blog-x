Hello and Welcome to my first blog post ever !!!<br/><br/>
Let's talk about the technology that powers this blog.
The blog is made using `Jekyll`, a framework for creating static webpages.
This wonderful framework is what powers `Github`. Jekyll is beautiful in it's simplicity. No Databases, No update problems and
you can just write your content in a simple Markdown file.

Want to create your own blog ? It's as simple as advertised. Let's get to it.
